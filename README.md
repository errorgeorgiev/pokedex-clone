### Pokedex App ###
The web application uses "https://dex-server.herokuapp.com/" as a data source and Apollo for the graphql client. The app uses React(Functional components with hooks) + JavaScript. For the design, I have used Chakra UI.

The app is able to list all Pokemon and their abilities. You can click on a Pokemon to see additional information about it's abilities. You can select multiple Pokemon, save them locally in the browser and after pressing the 'Fight' button, a random enemy pokemon will be generated. 
There is simple algorithm which shows which of the chosen Pokemon is the best pick against the random enemy.  


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
